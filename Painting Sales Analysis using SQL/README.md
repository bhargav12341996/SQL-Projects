üé® Painting Sales Analysis - SQL Portfolio Project

üìå Problem Statement

* Identify trends and insights from sales transactions.

* Monitor artist performance.

* Detect data quality issues such as duplicates.

* Answer common business questions using SQL.

üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema
This project consists of four core tables:

1. paintings

* id (int): Unique painting ID

* name (varchar): Title of the painting

* artist_id (int): Foreign key to artists.id

* listed_price (float): Price listed for sale

2. artists
* id (int): Unique artist ID

* first_name, last_name (varchar): Artist name

3. collectors
* id (int): Unique collector ID

4. sales
* id (int): Unique sale ID
