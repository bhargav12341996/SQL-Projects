# ðŸ“¦ Sales Order Analysis Using SQL

This project demonstrates how to analyze a typical sales database using SQL. It covers real-world scenarios related to order processing, customer information, inventory management, pricing discrepancies, and time-based sales analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Sales and operations teams need consistent reporting and insights into product performance, customer behavior, and order health. This SQL project simulates such business queries and analysis from raw sales data to help:

- Detect inconsistencies in sales orders and customer records
- Understand product line-level performance
- Track shipping timelines and pricing anomalies
- Audit customer activity by geography
- Support operational KPIs like total revenue, average order value, and product demand

### ðŸ”— Relationships

- **sales_order.customer** â†’ **customers.customer_id**
- **sales_order.product** â†’ **products.product_code**

Each order belongs to a customer and involves a specific product.
